# This is a heading, this is my first homework assignment for this class.
## This is a subheading, this is hopefully smaller than the heading above...
### THIS is the smallest subheading (that i know of at least).


<p>Down here I will be typing <sub>normal</sub> text. But I also want to use some 
**BOLD** text, or maybe some *italics* but I should probably ~~strike through~~ all of this.<br>
Another requirment of this assignment is that I upload a link to
[my github repository](https://github.com/UW-ESS-DS/MLGeo-Autumn22Links)<p>

<p>Here is a list of my favorite Earth Science topics<p>
1. Hydrothermal Vents
2. Estuaries
3. lidar
